üåü Project Overview

Jivafit is a deep learning model designed to predict the risk of various diseases. It is built using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a fundamental type of neural network capable of learning complex, non-linear relationships from structured data. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive tool that can analyze a wide range of health-related data points, such as symptoms, lab results, and demographic information, to assess an individual's potential risk for specific health conditions.
